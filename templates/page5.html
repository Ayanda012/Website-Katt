    <p>•The pie chart represents the distribution of various power sources.</p>
    <p>•Coal Station: This is the largest segment, occupying 80% of the chart. It indicates that most of the power comes from coal stations.</p>
    <p>•Renewable Energy: This segment represents 7% of the chart, showing that a small portion of power is generated from renewable sources.</p>
    <p>•Nuclear Power: This segment accounts for 5% of the power sources.</p>
    <p>•Pumped Water: This segment accounts for 2% of the power sources.
        The chart indicates a relatively low contribution of renewable energy sources to the overall electricity generation mix. This suggests a potential opportunity for increasing investment and development in renewable energy infrastructure to diversify the energy mix, reduce dependence on fossil fuels like coal, and address environmental concerns associated with carbon emissions and other pollutants from traditional power generation sources.
        </p>
    <p>•Hydro Water and Open Cycle Gas Turbine: Each of these segments represents 1% of the power sources.</p>
    <p>•IPP OCGT: This segment has a 0% share, indicating that it does not contribute to the power sources.</p>
    <p>This chart provides a clear visual representation of how different power sources contribute to the overall power supply. Coal Station is the dominant source, while other sources like Renewable Energy, Nuclear Power, and Imports also contribute, but to a lesser extent. The IPP OCGT does not contribute to the power sources.</p>
